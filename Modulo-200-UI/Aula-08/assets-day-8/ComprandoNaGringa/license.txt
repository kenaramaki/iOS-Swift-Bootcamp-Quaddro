You would like to use the Apple Software (as defined below) to develop one or more Applications (as defined below) for Apple-branded products. Apple is willing to grant You a limited license to use the Apple Software and Services provided to You under this Program to develop and test Your Applications on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Applications developed under this Agreement for iOS Products, Apple Watch, or Apple TV can be distributed in four ways: (1) through the App Store, if selected by Apple, (2) through the B2B Program area of the App Store, if selected by Apple, (3) on a limited basis for use on Registered Devices (as defined below), and (4) for beta testing through TestFlight. Applications developed for macOS can be distributed through the App Store, if selected by Apple, or separately distributed under this Agreement.

Applications that meet Apple's Documentation and Program Requirements may be submitted for consideration by Apple for distribution via the App Store, B2B Program, or for beta testing through TestFlight. If submitted by You and selected by Apple, Your Applications will be digitally signed by Apple and distributed, as applicable. Distribution of free (no charge) Applications (including those that use the In-App Purchase API for the delivery of free content) will be subject to the distribution terms contained in Schedule 1 to this Agreement.

If You would like to distribute Applications for which You will charge a fee or would like to use the In-App Purchase API for the delivery of fee-based content, You must enter into a separate agreement with Apple (“Schedule 2”). If You would like to distribute Applications via the B2B Program, You must enter into a separate agreement with Apple (“Schedule 3”). You may also create Passes (as defined below) for use on Apple-branded products running iOS or watchOS under this Agreement and distribute such Passes for use by Wallet.
